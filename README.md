# Context API with Session Storage Example

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the usage of Context API with session storage for state management. It provides a lightweight alternative to Redux for less complex applications.

## Features

- Increment and reset a counter value using buttons.
- The counter value is persisted across page refreshes using session storage.
- The state is managed using React's Context API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (version 6 or above)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory: 
    ```shell
    npm install

3. Start the application:
    ```shell
    npm start

4.Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application.

## Folder Structure
 - public/: Contains the public assets and the HTML template for the application.
 - src/: Contains the application source code.
 - App.tsx: The root component of the application.
 - Context/AppContext.tsx: Defines the context and provides state and actions to components.
 - components/: Contains the application components.

 ## Usage
The application consists of a single component, MyComponent, which demonstrates the usage of the counter state and the provided actions.

To modify the application or add new components:

1. Create your new component in the components/ folder.
2. Import the AppContext from AppContext.tsx and use the useContext hook to access the state and actions.
3. Render the state values and utilize the actions within your component.
4. Update the App.tsx file to include your new component or modify the existing components.
